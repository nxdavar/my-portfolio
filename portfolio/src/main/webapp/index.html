      <h2> Introduction </h1>
      <p> My name is Neal Davar and I am a junior computer science student at 
          The University of Texas at Austin. I have demonstrated experience in
          cross platform mobile app development (Flutter and React Native) and 
          full stack web development (with what is traditionally known as the Microsoft
          stack => ASP.NET, Razor HTML, and the MVC design pattern).
      </p>

      <h2> Journey Into the World of Computer Science </h1>
      <p> My journey into the world of software development was somewhat atypical.
        I was formerly a pre-medical student with a burning desire to help people.
        However, more recently, I have realized I can obtain the satisfaction of helping
        people at a potentially larger scale through the world of computer science. 
        This realization and reflection upon my characteristics of being a lifelong learner
        and someone who enjoys tinkering with new technologies led to me finding this field interesting.
        I hope working as a software developer in the industry will allow me to put these interests to
        use on a larger scale and potentially solve global issues.

        <p>Built a Flutter mobile application to target the issue of people staying indoors too much during quarantine.
            The app gamified the experience of finding a green space or local business location. Over the course
            of the 24 hour HackTX 2021 hackathon, my team and I used the OpenWeatherAPI to give messages of encouragement
            depending on the weather and time of day.

        <p>
            Developed a club hub application for school as a part of a year-long personal project.
